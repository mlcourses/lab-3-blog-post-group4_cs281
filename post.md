# Lab 3: Ramp Circuit!

Please write a blog post describing your lab here.

This is just an example of how you might structure your blog post, feel free to edit as you wish. For example, you might divide the lab into different sections each with their own intro, instructions, results, and takeaways. Please see the rubric for details on how the post will be evaluated.

## Overview and Motivation
This week we'll explore...

## Materials
1. PB-503 (breadboard)
2. Electrical Wires
3. Arduino Kit
4. 7404 NOT Gate
5. 7408 AND Gate
6. 7486 XOR Gate
7. 7 Segment Display

## Project Steps
1. Combinatorial Circuit

2. Voltage Divider

3. Potentiometer with Arduino
  We used the Arduino to convert the analog input of the potentiometer into a digital representation.

  First, we connected the potentiometer to the Arduino to calibrate it. 

  We wrote the included program into our Arduino, and then began to test it by turning the knob of the potentiometer. As we turned the knob, we saw on our computer that the Arduino was converting it to values between 0 and 5. This was a digital output, the values 0 to 5 were actually 3 binary bits, which could be written to represent values from 0 to 7. These three binary bits are the input into our circuit which converts this binary information into its proper representation on the 7 Segment Display.

5. 7 Segment Display
